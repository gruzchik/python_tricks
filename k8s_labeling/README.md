# Labels

Here have a some list of resources that described in targettext.txt, the main demand for codebase this is ability to select some part of resources and implement some actions for them

For example we have a list and we need to update labels for the first 2 lambda-fix* configmaps, in that case it was  'labelname=value'

The file **action_targeting.sh** is able to do this using bash. Please create a python of js file with the same functionality

An example or output in bash, please update it in python(js)
